### ❓ 9. Discount usage vs wallet balance?

### 🔍 Query:
```SQL
-- While cleaning 'customer_profiles' table I found out only 198 distinct customer names out of 1000 records.

-- And also found duplicates have different customer_id and email_id but same customer_name and contact_number.

-- So I thought customers might be going wild on discounts, creating multiple accounts while exploiting discount guidelines and then I decided to use the following query:

SELECT CP.customer_name,
       Sum(A.discount_issued) AS discount_usage,
       Sum(A.wallet_balance)  AS wallet_balance
FROM   customer_profiles CP
       JOIN accounts A
         ON CP.customer_id = A.customer_id
GROUP  BY CP.customer_name
HAVING discount_usage > 35000
       AND wallet_balance > 5000
ORDER  BY discount_usage DESC;
-- Remove the HAVING clause to see complete output.
